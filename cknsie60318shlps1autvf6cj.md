## AWS Compute

---
### Amazon EC2 

> 
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

---

### AWS Batch

> AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web Services Cloud.

---

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

> AWS Elastic Beanstalk helps to deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications.

---

### EC2 Image Builder 

> EC2 Image Builder is a fully-managed AWS service that makes it easier to automate the creation, management, and deployment of customized, secure, and up-to-date "golden" server images that are pre-installed and pre-configured with software and settings to meet specific IT standards.

---

### End-of-Support Migration Program for Windows Server (EMP)

> The End-of-Support Migration Program for Windows Server (EMP) migrates legacy applications from Windows Server 2003, 2008, and 2008 R2 to newer, supported versions on AWS without any code refactoring and also decouples the application from the existing operating system and packages it with all necessary application files and components.

---

### AWS Lambda

> AWS Lambda can run code without provisioning or managing servers where you pay only for the compute time that you consume - there's no charge when your code isn't running.

---

### AWS Launch Wizard

> AWS Launch Wizard reduces the time it takes to deploy application and domain-controller solutions to the cloud by providing easy step-by-step guidance.

---

### Amazon Lightsail

> Amazon Lightsail helps developers get started using AWS to build websites or web applications and includes the features that you need to launch your project: instances (virtual private servers), managed databases, SSD-based block storage, static IP addresses, load balancers, content delivery network (CDN) distributions, DNS management of registered domains, and snapshots (backups) which all available for a low, predictable monthly price.

---

### AWS Outposts

> AWS Outposts brings native AWS services, infrastructure, and operating models to virtually any data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility which you can use the same services, tools, and partner solutions to develop for the cloud and on premises.

---

### AWS ParallelCluster

> AWS ParallelCluster is an AWS supported open source cluster management tool that helps you to deploy and manage high performance computing (HPC) clusters in the AWS Cloud.

---

### AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)

> The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an open-source framework that enables you to build serverless applications on AWS and provides you with a template specification to define your serverless application, and a command line interface (CLI) tool.

---

### AWS Serverless Application Repository

> The AWS Serverless Application Repository is a managed repository for serverless applications which enables teams, organizations, and individual developers to find, deploy, publish, share, store, and easily assemble serverless architectures.

---

### AWS Wavelength

> AWS Wavelength allows developers to build applications that deliver ultra-low latencies to mobile devices and end users which deploys standard AWS compute and storage services to the edge of telecommunication carriers' 5G networks.
