## Installing Python 

### On Windows 


1. Choose Your Version
2. Download Python Executable Installer from [here](http://link.saranmahadev.tech/officialpython)
3. Run the Executable Installer 
4. Make Sure to check the **Add Python 3.x to Path**  and also make sure of the installation of **pip**.     5. Once the Python is installed successfully, verify the installation by typing

```
python --version
``` 
which will give you the version of the Python installed.

### On Linux
> Most of the time Linux comes with Python 2.x/3.x preinstalled but if not follow the process given below

**In Debian**

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev \ 
libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev curl
``` 

**In Fedora**

```
sudo dnf groupinstall development
``` 

(or)

- Just get the stable release from [Python](https://link.saranmahadev.tech/officialpython) offical site and extract them using tar as given

```
tar -xf Python-3.x.x.tar.xz
``` 
- After extraction, configure by entering

```
$ cd Python-3.x
./configure
``` 

Either way, always make sure to verify the installation by typing

```
python --version
``` 

### On Macos
Most recommended approach is to go to the official site and get the installer and install using **.pkg** file.

## Modes in Python

There are two modes in python

### Interactive Mode
In Interactive mode of python, it provides us the immediate feedback for code written as piece and on the whole. you can open the interactive by typing **python** on your terminal.

Example:

```
>>> a = 10
>>> print(a)
10
``` 
### Script Mode
In Script mode of python, we can write the entire code and give it to the interpreter, the interpreter executes line by line and gives the output accordingly.

Example:
It started with Ada Lovelace, as a fellow programmer its our duty to print "Hello World!" when you start an programming language. So in the Script mode,

```
$cat >> app.py \\ Creates a File called app.py
print('Hello World')

\\ [ctrl + c] given here to insert the code into the file
$python app.py
Hello World

``` 

## Conclusion
For now,  its ok to not knowing the code written, just chill we just said "Hello" to the whole "World", make sure to subscribe on YouTube for the upcoming content.
