## Lets Take the Challenge!

## Introduction:
The goal is to become a successful Cloud Engineer and  I follow Gwyneth PeÃ±a-Siguenza, an interesting Self Taught Cloud Computing Engineer who released an open source Journey to become a Cloud Engineer. I looked into it and it looks awesome. I am taking the challenge and I am going to complete all the projects given. It has four phases of learning.

- Phase 1 - Linux and Networking Essentials
- Phase 2 - Learn some scripting and code
- Phase 3 - Learn a Cloud platform
- Phase 4 - Learn some DevOps practices

## My Approach

I am learning Cloud Computing for a year now and I believe it starts from the beginning and so I am modifying the approach of the Challenge.

### Phase 1

In the Phase 1 - **Linux and Networking Essentials** , there are some resources listed and since I already have two years experience in Linux and Networking. I am going ahead and I am completing all the projects given.

The Listed Projects are 

- Install Linux on a Computer

I am installing **Linux Mint** on my test bench.

- Setup a Lamp Server

I will setup a LAMP Server on AWS

- Deploy a NAS Server

I don't have the resources to deploy a NAS server, so lets skip that

- Deploy your own Cloud

I am using NextCloud and going to deploy my own cloud

### Phase 2

In Phase 2 - Learn some scripting and code, As I am already have plenty of experience and PCAP Training in Python, I am jumping to the Projects. 

#### 1. Product Inventory Project

I have to create an application to create an Product Inventory.

** Tech Stack: **
1. Python(Flask) - For UI
2. MongoDB - For Storing
3. Azure - For Hosting

#### 2. Create Your GitHub Profile 
I already have an GitHub Profile and I am editing it.

### Phase 3

In Phase 3 - Cloud Platform, I have AWS Fundamentals Specialization and I also learning for Cloud Practitioner and as you have guessed we are skipping to the Projects. The Given Projects are

> I skipped some projects.. take a look [here](https://github.com/madebygps/self-taught-guide-to-cloud-computing/blob/main/phase3/README.md) for that projects

#### 1. Creating a Automated Script

I love to automate stuff and I am creating a Automation script to deploy an Ubuntu VM in AWS.

#### 2. 100 Days of Cloud
As I skipped some projects, I am taking some work from [100DaysOfCloudIdeas](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas) repo and going to do work in different cloud providers.

#### 3. Creating Serverless Functions

I have the problem of automatic updating of Blogs in my portfolio, so I am going to create AWS Serverless function for that and also I am writing the problem statement work which states to write a function to email me very morning about weather and the VM's running. Also an HTTP Function that shows the resume details.

In Phase 4- DevOps, it is an interesting topic and I love using DevOps tools. I encountered with Docker, Jenkins and Terraform during the 30 Days of Cloud Challenge and I have been using Docker for more than 3 months for an interesting project, we are working on and we will revealed later and I am using the resources given and I am learning and I am going to 

- Deploy a VPN and 2 VM's in the Cloud with Terraform and also
- I am going to deploy a NAS project with terraform

## Conclusion

Lets take the Challenge and see How it goes.. I believe, I can do this. I am going to call this series as Road to Cloud Engineer. Join me in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/qZbxkqDfsP), if you want to help or something you want to discuss.
